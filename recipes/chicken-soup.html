    <p>When my body is tired and achy, or I’m feeling a bit under the weather
        , I always throw together this Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup recipe. 
        The aroma that fills my house as it cooks is absolutely soothing to the 
        soul, and the “from scratch” chicken soup flavor makes it the ultimate 
        comfort food. There’s no bouillon or canned broth here folks, because this 
        chicken soup is the real deal. But don’t worry, despite being made from 
        scratch, this surprisingly simple and easy recipe makes the BEST homemade 
        chicken noodle soup with very little hands-on time!</p>
