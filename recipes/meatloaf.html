    <p>The concept of meatloaf kind of makes me raise an eyebrow because, 
        well, it’s a loaf of meat. But when it’s executed well it’s just so
         good. This easy meatloaf is so filling, so cozy, and so delicious 
         that I look forward to eating the leftovers over the next few days 
         (hello meatloaf sandwich, I’m looking at you). This easy meatloaf 
         recipe is the traditional homemade meatloaf that we all know and 
         love—tender, juicy, full of flavor, and with the perfectly tangy 
         tomato glaze on top. It’s so perfect when paired with mashed 
         potatoes and green beans. Like a plate of pure comfort!</p>
